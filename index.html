		<h2 style="color:blueviolet;margin-bottom:-20">The History Of Pasta</h2>
		<p style="color:blueviolet">
	There are many theories to the origins of pasta, some say that it was brought back by Marco Polo after he was inspired by a variation of noodles in China. However, there have been mentions of pasta, more specifically macaroni, in Sicily. In the 1300's, pasta became incredibly popular. It gradually became a staple of the diet of most Italians by the 1600's, and Italians were nicknamed <i>mangiamaccheroni</i> or macaroni-eaters. It wasn't for a while until tomatoes and pesto became commonplace and eventually became the most popular pasta.

		<h2 style="color:cornflowerblue;margin-bottom:-20">Types Of Pasta</h2>
		<p style="color:cornflowerblue">
	Pasta can be found in many shapes and sizes, there are some classic sizes and then there are some more fun variations. There are noodles like spaghetti, fettucine, angel hair and linguine. Some are thin and round, some are thicker and some are flat. There are some pastas that we stuff like ravioli, gnocchi and tortellini and then there are pastas like penne, farfalle and rotini. There are pastas that we bake like lasagna as well. Serafina, an Italian restaurant, makes a tennis racket pasta.

		<h2 style="color:forestgreen;margin-bottom:-20">Preparations of Pasta</h2>
		<p style="color:forestgreen">
		There are 4 main preparations of pastas. There is tomato sauce, which by the name you can tell is made by simmering chopped tomatoes with some olive oil and garlic. There is a variant of tomato sauce called arrabiata, which is a bit spicy. There is a recipe that uses cream and cheese, the type of cheese can vary, you can use hard or soft cheeses. There is a pesto sauce which is made from basil and pine nuts amongst other things. The last but certainly not the least is a sauce with oil, garlic, some butter, and pepper.

		<h2 style="color:cadetblue;margin-bottom:-20">Pasta in NYC</h2>
		<p style="color:cadetblue">
			New York City has some of the best restaurants in the world, and those resatuarants have some of the best tasting pastas. One of my personal favorite joints is a restaurant in Williamsburg called Barano, along with its excellent pasta's it has a killer pizza as well. Another really good restaurant is Celeste, it's on the Upper West Side and has some of the creamiest pasta ever. The place with probably the best ambience however is probably Gigino's at Wagner Park, it's right on Wagner park and on the right, you can enjoy the beautiful sunset and a grassy field.
